Sorting Algorithms... Visualized!

UI Design:
    - Top nav bar with selections for different sorting algorithms (qs, bubble, merge, etc)
    - Left side of page:
        - Description of algorithm, time complexity, etc
        - Read only text area with algorithm definition
        - Future: as visualization is running, highlight line of the algorithm being worked on
    - Right side 
        - Top of container: 
            - Input box for # of elements in array to sort
            - 2 buttons 1 to generate new array and 1 to start the sorting process
        - Visual of array
